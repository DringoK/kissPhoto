# Kissphoto Manual

## Basic idea

keep it simple:
- just files (no database)
- parse filenames for renumbering and mass renaming
- cursor through lines in edit mode like in plain text
- "saving" will just rename the files

      
## install kissPhoto

Start the installer
- kissPhoto.msi for Windows
- kissPhoto.deb for Debian based Linux (e.g. Ubuntu)

Start kissPhoto.
Open the menu Extra/language and select your preferred language.

## Use kissPhoto

- open a file with menu file/open...

kissPhoto will open the directory of the file and select the file
