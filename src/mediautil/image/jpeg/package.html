This package consists of Utilities for Jpeg Images.

Currently it features a class LLJTran for lossless Jpeg Transformation and
classes like Exif (Which extends AbstractImageInfo) for handling Jpeg Image
Header Information. LLJTran works with Sub Classes of AbstractImageInfo like
Exif to provide for retrieving and changing Image Header Information as well.
